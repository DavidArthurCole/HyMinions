				ul
					li Real time AH and bazaar prices (refreshed every 10 minutes)

					li Tailor-made for each profile (HOTM Level and Gemstone Collection Level)

				p.d-inline-block: a(href="/minionscost") Click to try
				p Jul 2021
				p It calculates the cheapest minions to level up to gain more minion slots, also tailor-made for each profile if you input your Minecraft name. It also shows you how much money you need to spend on materials to unlock a new minion tier.

					h4 Integrations with minions profit calculator
					p When Voidling Minion is out, I often heard some comments saying: "Tier 11 voidling minion costs over 200 million, it is not reasonable putting it on the top of the profit list!" 
					p I understand that, so here is where my new minion crafts calculator comes in handy. We could estimate the tier of the minions you have based on the number of minion slots you have. The default setting is 23 minion slots, so voidling minion would be set at tier 3, hence balance the whole ecosystem.
					h4 Miscellaneous
					p Added Hardstone Minion

				h3.d-inline-block Minion Calculator Update &nbsp; &nbsp;
				p.d-inline-block: a(href="/minions") Click to try
				p May 2021
				p The new minion calculator would calculate the profit based on your frequency of collecting minions.
				p For example, lapis minions could be a good minion for active players, who collect enchanted lapis before they are automatically converted into enchanted lapis blocks, but not for those who are less active.
				#collapseAnnouncementsMay2021.collapse
					p To use the new minion calculator, you could either type in your name and offline duration right here on the homepage or go to the <a href="/minions">minions</a> page if you would like to change some settings. (e.g. fuel/ diamond spreading)
					p If you wish to use the old settings, you could click <a href="minions/?calculationType=0&diamondSpreading=1&sellingMethod=0">here</a> to have the previous settings prefilled for you. 
					h4 Link sharing
					p You could share the URL of the website after you have entered your settings and clicked apply. For example, <a href="/minions/?name=technoblade&offlineTime=240&/#content"> this link </a> gives the minion profit list of Technoblade for 10 days of offline time.
					p This saves time typing your desired settings every time you visit the site, and it makes sharing specific minion profit lists easier.
					h4 Miscellaneous
					ul
						li Added tier 12 farming minions
						li Changed default settings from "sell offer" to "sell instantly" at the bazaar, to stabilize the bazaar prices
						li Aesthetic improvements
						li Fixed Voidling Minion product output amount
						li Added Lesser Soulflow Engine as an experimental feature
						li Added Voidling Minion and new variants of ender pearl
					p You could submit bug reports or comments <a href="/contact">here</a>. I hope you all like the update. Thank you!
